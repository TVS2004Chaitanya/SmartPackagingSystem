# Smart Packaging System

## Overview

**Smart Packaging System** is a computer vision application that identifies and classifies groceries in real-time, delivering immediate feedback.
Leveraging OpenCV and the YOLOv5 model, this application detects various groceries and fruits, evaluates the freshness of the fruits, and extracts expiry dates using PyTesseract.

## Features
- Real-time detection of groceries using computer vision.
- Assessment of fruit freshness.
- Extraction of expiry dates.
- Capability to identify multiple groceries within a single frame.
- Facilitates efficient billing for your cart.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: For computer vision tasks like capturing images and processing.
- **machineLearninr**: To build the Yolov5 model.
- **Python**: Backend logic for detection.
- **Pytesseract**:To extract text from images for verifying expiry dates and labels.
